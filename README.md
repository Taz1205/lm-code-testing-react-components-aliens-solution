# Testing React Components - Model Solution

This isn't a _perfect_ solution, because such a thing doesn't exist!

But it is a decent solution.

👉 Take some time to explore this repo and understand the techniques being used.

⚠️ We don't expect you to have used all the techniques shown here! They go beyond the instructions given in the assignment and some advanced TypeScript is used in places. But hopefully you can understand the approach and begin to integrate some of these techniques in your future projects.

👉 Run the app with `npm install` and `npm start` and try out the form.

👉 Notice the validation uses a `touched` flag to only display messages once the user has interacted with an input.

👉 Notice the validation errors are broken into multiple specific errors - in other words, we don't give users a vague error like "Must be more than 2 chars and less than 23 chars and not contain numbers or special characters". We can say EXACTLY which rule (or rules) they are breaking, which is a much nicer user experience.

👉 Notice the use of some complex typing with `keyof` to make our state updates very simple - each input uses the _exact same_ `onChangeHandler` function.

👉 Notice the validation rules being defined for each input as an array of basic rules - this means we can write tests for those basic rules and then just combine them as we need for each input.

👉 Notice the tests for the `TextInput` and `SelectInput` and understand all of the tests being applied. Explore all the other tests too!
